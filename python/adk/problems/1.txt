PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE & SYSTEMS DESIGN

SCENARIO:
Your organization is building a shared enterprise platform that supports:
    - Inbound & outbound integrations (internal systems, partners, vendors)
    - Event ingestion & processing (real-time + near-real-time)
    - Notification delivery across:
        - Email
        - SMS
        - Push
        - In-app messages

The platform must support:
    - Multi-tenant workloads
    - At-least-once delivery
    - Event replay
    - Idempotency
    - Consent & preference enforcement
    - Regional isolation (data residency)
    - 99.99% availability for critical notifications

DELIVERABLES:
Provide a written architecture proposal (diagrams optional, text acceptable).
Address the following:

1. High-Level Architecture
    - Event ingestion pattern (sync vs async)
    - Event backbone choice (stream vs queue)
    - Separation of concerns (integration vs processing vs delivery)
    - Multi-tenant isolation strategy

2. Event Processing Model
    - Ordering guarantees
    - Deduplication
    - Replay strategy
    - Schema evolution and versioning
