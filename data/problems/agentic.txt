AGENTIC AI PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE & SYSTEMS DESIGN

SCENARIO:

Your organization is building a shared enterprise Agentic AI platform that supports:
	•	Autonomous and semi-autonomous agents
	•	Multi-step reasoning and planning
	•	Tool and API invocation
	•	Human-in-the-loop interactions
	•	Cross-agent collaboration

The platform must support:
	•	Multi-tenant workloads
	•	Long-running and resumable agent executions
	•	At-least-once agent actions
	•	Idempotent tool execution
	•	State and memory persistence
	•	Policy, safety, and guardrail enforcement
	•	Regional isolation (data residency)
	•	99.99% availability for critical agents

DELIVERABLES:

Provide a written architecture proposal (diagrams optional, text acceptable).

Address the following:

1. High-Level Architecture
	•	Agent execution pattern (sync vs async)
	•	Orchestration model (event-driven vs workflow-based)
	•	Separation of concerns (planning vs execution vs tools)
	•	Agent runtime and model access layer
	•	Multi-tenant isolation strategy

2. Agent Execution & State Model
	•	Planning and re-planning strategy
	•	State and memory management
	•	Deduplication of agent actions
	•	Replay and resume strategy
	•	Handling partial failures and retries

3. Tooling & Control Plane
	•	Tool registration and invocation model
	•	Idempotency and side-effect control
	•	Human approval checkpoints
	•	Policy and guardrail enforcement
	•	Observability and audit logging

4. Evolution & Reliability
	•	Agent definition and prompt versioning
	•	Deterministic replay for debugging
	•	Schema evolution for tools and memory
	•	Safe rollout of new agent behaviors
